Yet for its creator, this was sufficient — as a mere pawn, those memories steeped in agony served as potent fuel, enough to turn the Hollow upside down and expose all secrets to the world.\nThus, driven by memories not its own, the Miasma that birthed it made it restless, the approaching Ethereals filled it with rage, and even while prowling its own territory, it remained forever uneasy.\nOnly once, when it chased a human to the edge of the Hollow and saw the fear on their face, was its hunting instinct unexpectedly overridden by a strange impulse. It came to an involuntary stop. And when that unlucky figure vanished from view, it felt something new: an emotion startlingly close to satisfaction.\nBut that sense of satisfaction didn't last. A group of humans in black armor began intruding into its territory again and again, unfazed by any threat. Agitation and exhaustion slowly wore it down — until all it wanted was for everything that moved to disappear. Disappear!

Its gaze followed the glint of silver hair, so much like its own, desperate to see if the voice belonged to the figure that kept resurfacing in its memory.\nDistracted, it took a direct hit to its core from behind, the excruciating pain nearly breaking it. Yet it still heard that faint whisper:\n\"I'm sorry, I must do this...\"\nThough the words made no sense to it, that near-satisfying emotion returned. It became aware that something genuinely frightening now had it in its grip. It might die because of it... but it had no intention of fleeing.\nIn the end, its strength was completely spent. But in that final moment, it could finally see her clearly. She wasn't quite the same as in its memories, and that fleeting realization brought a trace of loneliness. But even so, it liked her current self more than the heart-shattering screams of the past.\n\n\"The 'Miasmic Fiend'...

    "desc": "Even among Ionized enemies renowned for their strange and uncanny qualities, Ionized Doppelgangers are exceptionally unique.\nThese entities can coat their bodies with a layer of special active Ether ions, enabling them to accurately replicate their target's form, often to a degree that makes it hard to tell the difference. Both in detail and texture, it is almost impossible to tell apart from the original.\nEven more challenging is their ability to mimic the powerful and intimidating combat techniques of their targets.\nNo one knows where they obtain the information about the subjects they mimic. Some rumors suggest they can read minds, picking out the most suitable challengers from their opponent's memories, and then attack in that form.\n\"Nonsense!

After simple assembly and rough welding, these common materials are stacked together to form a rare and dangerous piece of machinery.\nTo make it run smoothly, the creator has \"thoughtfully\" removed the safety restrictions of the machine and, based on its rugged appearance, named it the Lumberjack.\nNo one knows how long the Lumberjack can run stably.\nPerhaps, at any moment, it could suddenly go berserk, swinging its high-speed rotating chainsaw and spikes with unmatched horsepower, launching an unstoppable logging fest that no one dares to stop.\nBut... this near-mad combat mode might just be the best modification outcome the creator had in mind.\n\"Why call it a 'Lumberjack'? There's no wood to chop in the Hollow, right?\"\n\"Yeah, that's why it's so angry. When it starts up, it's reckless...\"",
