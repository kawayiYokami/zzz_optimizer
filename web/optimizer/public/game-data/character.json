She grew up very privileged, with anything she could ever want within grasp... except for freedom.\nAfter her Ether Aptitude test results came back high, Lucy decided she wanted to be a Hollow investigator, but her family disapproved. She was met with harsh words, isolation and confinement, and emotional abuse which led to her deciding to leave to find her own freedom.\n\"Hmph! There's no chance I'll ever go back! If I'm found... then I can say goodbye to the stars and sky and I'll have to inherit the family business instead!\"\nLucy is extremely competitive. She loves to win and hates losing.\nCurrently, the one who has given her the most bitter taste of defeat is Caesar, so Lucy keeps challenging Caesar to duels, losing then challenging again, challenging then losing again.",

Once she came of age, Koleda willingly stepped up to untangle the mess, rallying the remaining company workforce and resources to revive the financially and reputationally vulnerable Belobog Heavy Industries.\nWith the help of new invaluable team members, Belobog eventually managed to regain its prominence in relevant sectors. Though not as resplendent as its prime, Belobog in its current state is still a notable newcomer in the field.\nThroughout her journey, Koleda amassed practical life experiences and professional know-how, building a circle of colleagues who back her up like family. Yet, to present herself as a leader, Koleda appears to intentionally adopt a stern tone when communicating with others.\nThis distinct growth trajectory has also contributed to Koleda's heightened maturity in certain aspects compared to her peers. \nNaturally, she might display a bit of childishness in certain aspects as well.\nHypothesis: Koleda's comparatively smaller stature among her peers may stem from her prolonged involvement in the Hollows. \nCurrently, there aren't any publicly accessible papers or research substantiating this theory, but I will continue to track this topic.",
